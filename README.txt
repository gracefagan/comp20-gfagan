Comp20 Spring 2019

1. This GitHub repository contains labs and assignments from Comp20: Web Programming at Tufts University.

2. My favorite assignment was the personal website assignment. This assignment gave me a lot of creative liberties and allowed me to experiment with HTML/CSS in fun ways. It was a lot of fun to go back and add JavaScript after I turned the intial assignment in.

3. I think I have grown as a problem solver, specifically in the context of programming. I learned how to thoroughly read documentation and how to debug using Google and Stack Overflow.

4. The most important thing I have learned in this course is how to work collaboratively on a programming project. I learned the basics of GitHub which enables me to share code with others and collaborate remotely on a project. I also learned how to foster positive group dynamics during the semester group project by focusing on effective communication, distributing tasks and prioritizing features. For example, my group found it really hard to meet as a whole group which forced us to break down the projects into little pieces that different individuals could work on separately.

5. I would like to delve deeper into web design. I'm interested in the user interaction of the products we created and found it really fun to incorporate art into the projects we did.
