	<h2> Introduction </h2>
		<p> I was hired to check security vulnerabilities on both the clientside
			and serverside for an Private Car Service web application. </p>

	<h2> Methodology </h2>
		<p> To start testing the web application, I used the black box method.
		I tried to insert javascript as data for the POST /rides request and
		then rendering it as HTML on the browser, but found that the app never
		directly renders the data as HTML, and uses a JSON format instead.
		I also tried inserting an HTML tag as the username of a passenger to render
		a photo. </p>

		<p> Next, I used OWASP ZAP to find vulnerabilities in the source code by
		scanning the web application's URL. Here, I found many vulnerabilities.</p>

	<h2> Abstract of Findings </h2>
		<p>There are various security vulnerabilities and threats to privacy.
		A major security threat is the ability for NoSQL Database injections, along
		with improper HTTP headers (X-Frame Header and Content-Type Header) 
		that would allow a malicious user to input bad data into the database.</p>

	<h2> Issues Found </h2>
		<h1 class="num">1<h1><h3>NoSQL Database Injections</h3>
		<div class="issue">
			<h4>Location</h4>
				<p>server.js, the web server implementation (specifically the POST request implementation)</p>
			<h4>Severity of Issue</h4>
				<p class="HIGH">HIGH</p><p>- Huge privacy concern (all database information can be 
				leaked), potential for malicious javascript to be rendered as HTML
				and affect all users</p>
			<h4>Description of Issue</h4>
				<p>I found this issue by manually looking through the js code. 
				In the post request, I found the code lacks validation of input
				before the entry gets added to the database. I then added an HTML
				tag to the username entry and the program was unable to render 
				a marker for the given passenger.</p>
			<h4>Proof of Vulnerability</h4>

				<img src="NoSQL2.png">
			<h4>Resolution</h4>
				<p>To fix this vulnerability, the programmer should remove all special
				characters from entries before putting them into the database. This
				can be done by downloading an npm mongo-query-parser to validate
				input before entry into the database. It is also important to include
				a Content-Type HTTP request header to verify the type of content
				expected from a request.</p>

		<h1 class="num">2<h1><h3>Clickjacking Attack</h3>
		<div class="issue">
			<h4>Location</h4>
				<p>server.js, the web server implementation, specifically in request headers</p>
			<h4>Severity of Issue</h4>
				<p class="Medium">Medium</p><p>- Privacy concern: Allows a malicious
					hacker trick the user into clicking something that is "hidden" behind
					a button, can be malicious if user deletes items or gives away
					private information, and can also be redirected to a dangerous 
					alternate URL.</p>
			<h4>Description of Issue</h4>
				<p>I found this issue using the OSWAP ZAP software.</p>
			<h4>Proof of Vulnerability</h4>
				<img src="Click1.png">
				<img src="Click2.png">
			<h4>Resolution</h4>
				<p>This is a simple fix that significantly increases the
				security of your webpage. Including an X-Frame-Options request
				header with the DENY = true.</p>

		<h1 class="num">3<h1><h3>Cross-Site Scripting</h3>
		<div class="issue">
			<h4>Location</h4>
				<p>server.js, the web server implementation,</p>
			<h4>Severity of Issue</h4>
				<p class="HIGH">HIGH</p><p>- A hacker could send malicious
				JavaScript as data to a post request that interrupts the
				flow of the program and can inject a virus or send a user to 
				a dangerous URL. This is a really powerful vulnerability! There
				are some protections against XSS currently, such as making sure
				the inputted Lat/Lng values are floating points and the inability
				for the Google Maps markers to render javascript, but XSS is
				still possible.</p>
			<h4>Description of Issue</h4>
				<p>I found this issue using the OSWAP ZAP software.</p>
			<h4>Proof of Vulnerability</h4>
				<img src="XSS1.png">
			<h4>Resolution</h4>
				<p>This is a simple fix that significantly increases the
				security of your webpage. To make sure XSS is not possible, 
				include a request header that protects against XSS possibilities.
				Within the header, the mode should be set to X-XSS-Protection = 1,
				mode = block.</p>

	<h2> Conclusions </h2>
		<p>In conclusion, this web application is lacking various protections that 
		provide signficant security and privacy vulnerabilities. At it's current state,
		it is easy for a hacker to access and change information stored in a database using
		NoSQL injections, and it is possible for a hacker to enable a Clickjacking Attack by
		hiding links or commands behind the displayed webpage to trick the user. Lastly,
		XSS protections are not as strong as they could be, making this web app
		vulnerable to malicious rendering of javascript code.</p>
	<h2> References </h2>
	<p> See links below each issue for more documentation on solutions. I used
	OSWAP's ZAP software to attack and scan the web application.</p>

	<p>**my partner's GET /passenger.json request was originally broken, so I was unable to test
	XSS possibilities with this feature.</p>
